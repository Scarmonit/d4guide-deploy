# Deployment Fix & Update

## Issue Resolved ✅

The original deployment URL (https://1111bb0d.d4guide.pages.dev) had expired or encountered issues.

## New Live URLs 🌐

Your website has been **redeployed successfully** with two working URLs:

### **1. Production URL (Recommended)**
**https://production.d4guide.pages.dev**

This is your stable production URL that won't change.

### **2. Preview URL**  
**https://cd3b56a3.d4guide.pages.dev**

This is a unique deployment preview URL.

## What Was Fixed

The issue was likely due to one of the following:
- Preview deployment URL expiration (preview URLs are temporary)
- Deployment incomplete or failed state
- Cache issues on Cloudflare's edge

## Verification

Both URLs are now live and working with your enhanced theme:
- ✅ All pages accessible
- ✅ CSS enhancements active
- ✅ Animations working
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Fast loading

## Recommendation

**Use the Production URL:** https://production.d4guide.pages.dev

This URL is stable, permanent, and tied to your production branch.

## Next Steps

To set up a custom domain (like scarmonit.com):

1. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Select your "d4guide" project
3. Go to "Custom domains"
4. Add your domain (scarmonit.com)
5. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
